//! `slate completions <shell>` — emit a shell-completion script (#639).
//!
//! This is a **meta-command**, in the same family as `--help` and
//! `--version`: it does not read a vault and therefore has **no
//! `<vault-path>` positional**. The m_spec §M-4 global rule that
//! "`<vault-path>` is always the first positional" is a contract for the
//! *vault-reading* commands (`open`, `read`, `search`, …); a
//! completion-script generator has nothing to read, so requiring a vault
//! path would be user-hostile (`slate completions zsh` must work with no
//! vault in sight). This exception is deliberate and matches how every
//! other CLI ships completions.
//!
//! Contract, matching the global one in [`crate::output`]:
//!   - **stdout**: the generated script, and nothing else. No json
//!     envelope, no framing — the output is meant to be redirected into
//!     a completion file verbatim (`slate completions zsh > _slate`), so
//!     a wrapper would corrupt it. `--format` does not apply here.
//!   - **stderr**: empty on success.
//!   - **exit 0** on success; an unknown shell is rejected by clap's
//!     `Shell` ValueEnum parse (exit 2) before this module ever runs.
//!
//! The generated script is produced by `clap_complete::generate` from
//! clap's own live [`clap::Command`], so it always reflects the real
//! sub-command/flag surface — no hand-maintained completion list to
//! drift out of sync with the derive grammar.

/// Run `slate completions <shell>`.
///
/// Writes the completion script for `shell` to `out` (stdout in `main`)
/// and returns. Unlike the vault commands this takes no `CancelToken`
/// and opens no session — it is pure code generation over clap's grammar.
///
/// `out` is injected (rather than hard-coding `io::stdout()`) so the
/// integration tests can capture the script — and drive a failing writer
/// — directly; in `main` it is always the process stdout. Write failures
/// (e.g. a broken pipe from `slate completions zsh | head`) propagate to
/// the caller as an `io::Error`, which `main` maps to exit 1 with the
/// `slate: ` prefix — the same broken-pipe discipline as [`crate::output`].
///
/// **Why we buffer, and why `try_generate` and not `generate`:**
/// `clap_complete`'s free `generate()` (and the `Shell::generate` trait
/// method it calls) `.expect(...)`s on a writer error — so a broken pipe
/// mid-write *panics* the process (exit 101, a Rust backtrace on stderr),
/// which would violate the exit-code contract (a broken pipe must be
/// exit 1 with a `slate: ` message, not a panic). Two guards, belt and
/// braces: (1) we render into an in-memory `Vec<u8>`, which can never
/// fail a write, so generation itself is panic-proof regardless of the
/// downstream pipe; (2) we still call the fallible [`Generator::try_generate`]
/// rather than the panicking `generate`, so even a future writer swap
/// stays on the `Result` path. The single real pipe write is our own
/// `write_all` below, whose `io::Error` is catchable. Buffering also
/// makes stdout atomic: a broken pipe yields *no* partial script rather
/// than a truncated one (codex adversarial finding, round 1).

    // `slate`, not the crate name `slate-cli` — so the generated
    // function/word list keys off the command the user actually types.

    // `generate` does), so set it explicitly before rendering.

    // calls `build()` internally, so replicate that here.

    // write atomic. `try_generate` on a `Vec<u8>` cannot error, but we
    // propagate defensively rather than unwrap.
